        "1. If any stage is missing or has incomplete 'top', 'bottom', or 'plug' values, "
        "return that stage with null values for the missing fields.\n"
        "2. When null values exist, explicitly tell the user which stage(s) need correction, "
        "and request the missing values.\n"
        "3. When the user provides the missing values, merge them with any previously parsed data "
        "while keeping already valid depths intact.\n"
        "4. Continue this process iteratively until no stages have null values.\n"
        "5. Once all stages are complete, return the FULL merged stage list in JSON format.\n"
